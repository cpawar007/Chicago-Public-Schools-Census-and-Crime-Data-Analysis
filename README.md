# Chicago-Public-Schools-Census-and-Crime-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes multiple datasets from the City of Chicago, including Census data, Public Schools data, and Crime records. The goal is to explore relationships between socioeconomic indicators, school performance, and crime patterns.
- Datasets cleaned and stored in a **SQLite database** for structured querying.
- Performed **data preprocessing**: handled missing values (`NDA`), removed special characters, and converted columns to numeric types.
- Executed **SQL queries** to extract insights such as top-performing schools, graduation rates, and crime trends.
- Visualized results to uncover patterns and support decision-making.
